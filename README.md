# 👋 Hi, I'm Xiocasso

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm the product initiator of **Ran（燃）**, a professional-grade analytics terminal focused on **CS skin trading** and virtual asset sentiment tracking.

## 🔥 About Ran（燃）

**Ran** is not just a skin price viewer — it's a **Bloomberg-style terminal** for the CS:GO market.

### Core modules:
- 📊 **Price Trend Visualization** (live snapshots, chart comparisons)
- 🧠 **AI-powered trend scoring** (volume + price + sentiment)
- 🔥 **Community Sentiment Heatmap** (keywords from Tieba, Discord, XHS)
- 📈 **Float, Rarity, Volume Filters** for traders and resellers
- 💼 **Pro Mode** for subscription users (bulk analysis, Steam portfolio valuation)

This project targets **high-frequency traders**, **market resellers**, and **serious virtual asset players**.

## 🧩 Why I'm Building This

CS skin trading is becoming more structured and financialized, but there's no serious, user-focused tool for decision-making.  
Ran aims to be the **go-to terminal** for anyone who wants to trade smarter.

I'm focused on:
- Product design
- Market demand & user workflows
- Monetization model
- Early user acquisition and feedback

I'm currently looking for a **technical co-founder/collaborator** skilled in:
- React + Chart.js (interactive UI)
- Python scraping (BUFF / CSFloat)
- API or data pipeline structuring

If you're looking to **co-create something real**, DM me.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Frontend: React + Tailwind + Zustand + Chart.js
- Data: Python (scraping, preprocessing), JSON static / API-ready structure
- Deployment: Netlify / Vercel
- AI: lightweight trend analysis models (planned)
